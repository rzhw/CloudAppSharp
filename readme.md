Copyright (c) 2010-2012 Richard Z.H. Wang <http://zhwang.me/>

## Introduction

This is a .NET wrapper around the CloudApp API. It's targeting .NET 4.0 for convenience, and should work on .NET 3.5 as well. It hasn't been tested with any other .NET versions.

## How to use

Simply add a reference to `CloudAppSharp.dll`. From there, everything you need can be found in the `CloudAppSharp.CloudApp` class. Everything (hopefully) is self-explanatory.
